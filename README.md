# AmpDriver
A plugin for digital audio workstations to emulate a guitar overdrive pedal, commonly placed in front of guitar amplifiers to remove some low frequency content and boost the signal going into the amp. It can also provide some extra distortion to change the overall tone, or add more to an amp that doesn't provide enough by itself.

## Compiling as a VST3
- Install [JUCE and the Projucer](https://juce.com/discover/projucer)
- Clone or download this repository
- Open the .jucer file using Projucer and add your IDE in the exporters section
- Select your IDE as the current exporter and open the project
- Build the VST3 or AU plugin

The project can also be built as a standalone executable but this has not been tested.
